# Machine Learning Flashcards

The goal of this repo is to compile a loose collection of flash cards summarizing AI/ML math foundations, machine learning concepts, code snippets, demos, etc. that can help facilitate ML/AI workshops, design sessions, deep dive presentations. 

The flash cards were compiled from the following reading list. It is highly recommended to refer to these publications for deeper and much more eloquent analysis.
